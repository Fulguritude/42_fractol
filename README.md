# 42_fractol
Keeping files on multiple machines for the 42 Fract'ol project (C fractal
renderer) and showcasing my code, as I largely exceeded the normal requirements.

# Goals
My objective was to create a general machine to explore C\[X], the space of
complex polynomials, by being able to feed any element of C\[X] (of computable
size) into an escape-time fractal (ETF) protocol like Julia's or Mandelbrot's
ETF algorithms (for which the default polynomial is P(z) = zÂ²).

# Usage
First argument is the dwell type (ETF protocol of choice), if another argument
is given, it should lead to a file with one single line of floats, which will
be interpreted as a complex polynomial. The leftmost two floats correspond to
the coef of degree zero.

# Dwell types/ETF protocols
Five are available: julia, mandelbrot, newton (not exactly the newton fractal,
a simpler version that took some inspiration from the standard newton 'root'
method of generating an escape-time fractal), burningship, and duquesne (this
last one is my own invention, just a POC to show my software can easily add
new ETF protocols). Each dwell type can work with every polynomial you could
come up with, up to degree 64 (not necessarily fast though, especially if the
display is dynamic). Not all polynomials give interesting results though, and
some might look more interesting for some dwell types than others.

# Settings inside software
Escape closes the software.

LCtrl toggles debug.
RCtrl toggles render mode (mariani-silver by default, or pixel-by-pixel, or
'none' which allows you to edit the value of your polynomial without the lag of
the real time render).
Space toggles staticity of display (when dynamic, mouse hover updates a
parameter of the fractal and calls the render function).
NumpadHome offers a slower, step-by-step rendering of Mariani-Silver (this gives
an idea of the algorithm's process and is useful for debugging).

Left-click recenters the fractol's anchor on the click's position.
Arrows recenter the anchor in an inversed fashion.

PageDown zooms in.
PageUp zooms out.
Scroll-up zooms in.
Scroll-down zooms out.

Numpad 0 to 9 correspond to 10 default palettes chosen, the default being
Numpad_8.

Numpad_+ and Numpad_- change the monomial the coefficient of which is being
updated by mouse_hover. Numpad_Enter sets the degree of the polynomial so that
the current monomial being edited becomes the term of highest degree.

# Saving
NumpadEnd prints the current polynomial to terminal: first line is human-
readable format, second line is machine readable format (you can copy that
single line in a file and save a polynomial you liked in 'cpolys' for later
use).

# Code macros
MAX_DWELL and WIN_H and WIN_W are macros if you want to edit them. MAX_DWELL
should be a power of 2 and COLOR_OFFSETs should be changed accordingly for the
palettes to keep working.
You can edit the definition of t_float in libft_shorthands.h for a speedup 
(it should be t_f64, aka 'double', by default).

#Portability
Not sure if Windows works, but the software works fine on both Linux (Ubuntu 
18.04) and Mac OS (though you might get some long error messages by 'ld' when
compiling with make; it'll still work).

# Other comments
I tried to make the call to render dependent on the speed of mouse movement and
got pretty good results. Also, imo, rather than scrolling it's more comfortable
to use PageUp and PageDown for zoom.
